# Working with Entities

In CycleORM, entities are at the heart of the ORM's functionality, serving as plain PHP objects that map to database records. Unlike Laravel's Eloquent ORM, which follows the Active Record pattern and combines domain logic with database interactions within model classes, CycleORM adopts the Data Mapper pattern. This approach clearly separates the persistence layer from the domain logic, allowing entities to remain lightweight and focused solely on representing the domain.
