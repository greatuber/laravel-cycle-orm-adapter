## 🗒️ Introduction

Adapter package provides a set of modified Laravel testing traits and methods to make testing easier, and as close as possible to native Laravel Testing methods, when using CycleORM.

## 🗑️ Resetting the Database After Each Test

@todo This trait is not yet implemented as native adapter functionality.

Currently, you can use default `Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase` trait to reset the database after each test. It will use the default Laravel database connection to reset the database.


## 🏭 Entity Factories

When testing, you may need to insert a few records into your database before executing your test. Instead of manually specifying the value of each column when you create this test data, Adapter package allows you to define a set of default attributes for each of your CycleORM [Entities](/usage/entities) using [Entity Factories](/services/factories).

Once you have defined an entity factory, you may utilize the factory within your test to create entities:

```php
use Database\Factories\Post\PostFactory;

/**
 * @test
 */
public function it_creates_post_entity_and_persists_it(): void
{
    $post = PostFactory::new()->create();

    // ...
}
```

## 👟 Running Seeders

If you would like to use [database seeders](/services/seeders) to populate your database during a feature test, you may invoke the `seed` method. By default, the `seed` method will execute the `DatabaseSeeder`, which should execute all of your other seeders. Alternatively, you pass a specific seeder class name to the `seed` method:

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Database\Seeders\Post\PostSeeder;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;
use Tests\TestCase;

class ExampleTest extends TestCase
{
    use RefreshDatabase;

    /**
     * @test
     */
    public function it_can_seed_posts(): void
    {
        // Run the DatabaseSeeder...
        $this->seed();

        // Run a specific seeder...
        $this->seed(PostSeeder::class);

        // ...

        // Run an array of specific seeders...
        $this->seed([
            OrderStatusSeeder::class,
            TransactionStatusSeeder::class,
            // ...
        ]);
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Available Assertions

This adapter package overrides Laravel's assertion methods to make them work with CycleORM entities. Use `WayOfDev\Cycle\Testing\Concerns\InteractsWithDatabase` trait in your base test case or in test cases where it is needed, instead of default Laravel `InteractsWithDatabase` trait.

### `assertDatabaseCount`

Assert that a table in the database contains the given number of records:

```php
$this->assertDatabaseCount('posts', 1);
```

### `assertDatabaseHas`

Assert that a table in the database contains records matching the given key / value query constraints:

```php
$this->assertDatabaseHas('posts', [
    'id' => $response->json('id'),
    'title' => 'New Post'
]);
```

### `assertDatabaseMissing`

Assert that a table in the database does not contain records matching the given key / value query constraints:

```php
$this->assertDatabaseMissing('posts', [
    'id' => $response->json('id'),
    'title' => 'New Post'
]);
```

### `assertSoftDeleted`

Assert that a given entity has been soft-deleted:

```php
$this->assertSoftDeleted('posts', [
    'id' => $post->id
]);
```

### `assertNotSoftDeleted`

Opposite to `assertSoftDeleted` method. Assert that a given entity has not been soft-deleted:

```php
$this->assertNotSoftDeleted('posts', [
    'id' => $post->id
]);
```
