# Laravel Telescope

## 🗒️ Introduction

<ExternalLink href="https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/telescope">Laravel Telescope</ExternalLink> is an elegant debug assistant for the Laravel framework. Telescope provides insight into the requests coming into your application, exceptions, log entries, database queries, queued jobs, mail, notifications, cache operations, scheduled tasks, variable dumps and more. Telescope makes a wonderful companion to your local Laravel development environment.

This adapter package provides you with abillity to also log and debug your Cycle ORM queries in Laravel Telescope.

## 📀 Installation

<div className="steps-container">

### Step 1: Install Telescope

Install, telescope as usual, via Composer package manager:

```bash
composer require laravel/telescope
```

### Step 2: Add .env Configuration

Add the following configuration to your `.env` file:

```dotenv filename=".env"
...

DB_USE_TELESCOPE_LOGGER=true

...
```

### Step 3: Publish Telescope Assets

After installing Telescope, publish its assets and migrations using the `telescope:install` Artisan command.

```bash
php artisan telescope:install
```

### Step 4: Run Telescope Migrations trough Cycle-ORM-Adapter

After installing Telescope, you should also run the migrate command in order to create the tables needed to store Telescope's data, but as you are using Cycle ORM, you should avoid using default `php artisan migrate` command, and instead, do the following steps:

Run the following command to create the Telescope tables:

```bash
php artisan cycle:migrate:init

php artisan cycle:orm:migrate --split --run
```

### Step 5: Add the CycleORM Query Watcher

Next, edit your `config/telescope.php` configuration file and add the following lines to the `watchers` array, right after the default`Watchers\QueryWatcher::class` line:

```php {13-18} filename="config/telescope.php"
return [
    // ...

    'watchers' => [
        // ...
        Watchers\QueryWatcher::class => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'ignore_packages' => true,
            'ignore_paths' => [],
            'slow' => 100,
        ],

        WayOfDev\Cycle\Bridge\Telescope\Watchers\QueryWatcher::class => [
            'enabled' => true,
            'ignore_packages' => true,
            'ignore_paths' => [],
            'slow' => 100,
        ],
    ],
    // ...
];
```

### Step 6: Access Laravel Telescope

Finally, you may access the Telescope dashboard via the `/telescope` route. Of course, don't forget to start your Laravel application:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
</div>

## 🎉 Final Result

Now, you can access the Laravel Telescope dashboard and see all the CycleORM queries executed by your application.
