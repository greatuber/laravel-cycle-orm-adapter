# Defining Entities

To get started with CycleORM entities in Laravel, you typically place your entity classes in the `app/Entities` directory. This is a departure from the conventional `app/Models` directory used by Eloquent.

Here's a basic example of a `Post` entity in CycleORM:

```php filename="app/Entities/Post.php" copy
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Entities;

use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Column;
use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Entity;
use Cycle\ORM\Entity\Behavior\Uuid\Uuid7;
use Ramsey\Uuid\UuidInterface;

#[Entity]
#[Uuid7(field: 'id')]
class Post
{
    #[Column(type: 'uuid', primary: true)]
    public UuidInterface $id;

    #[Column(type: "string")]
    private string $title;

    #[Column(type: "text")]
    private string $content;

    public function __construct(string $title, string $content)
    {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->content = $content;
    }

    public function id(): UuidInterface
    {
        return $this->id;
    }

    public function title(): string
    {
        return $this->title;
    }

    public function content(): string
    {
        return $this->content;
    }
}
```

By default, the laravel-cycle-orm-adapter is configured to scan the `app/Entities` directory for entities. However, you can customize this behavior by modifying the tokenizer section in the `config/cycle.php` configuration file. Here's how you can adjust it:

```php {4} filename="config/cycle.php"
return [
    'tokenizer' => [
        'directories' => [
            app_path('Entities'), // Directs CycleORM to scan this directory for entities
        ],
        // Additional configuration...
    ],
];
```

For projects adopting Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, it's common to place entities within a domain-specific layer, such as `Domain/Post`, rather than a single directory. This approach not only organizes your codebase around your business domain but also enhances the scalability and maintainability of your application.

Adjusting the `config/cycle.php` for a DDD structure might look like this:

```php {4,5} filename="config/cycle.php"
return [
    'tokenizer' => [
        'directories' => [
            __DIR__ . '/../src/Domain', // Load entities from all Domains
            __DIR__ . '/../vendor/wayofdev/laravel-webhook-client/src/Entities', // Load entities from vendor directory
        ],
        // Additional configuration...
    ],
];
```

This setup ensures that your Laravel application benefits from the clear separation of concerns provided by the Data Mapper pattern, with CycleORM efficiently managing the persistence of your domain entities.
