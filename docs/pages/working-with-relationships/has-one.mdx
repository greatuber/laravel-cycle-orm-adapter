# Has One (One-to-One)

The `HasOne` relationship in CycleORM signifies that an entity exclusively owns another entity in a parent-child relationship. This can be seen as a form of decomposition, with the ability to store child entity data in an external table. The `HasOne` relationship is used to define a connection to one child object, which will be automatically saved with its parent unless the `cascade` option is set to `false`.

```php filename="app/Entities/User.php"
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Entities;

use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Entity;
use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Relation\HasOne;

#[Entity]
class User
{
    // ...

    #[HasOne(target: Profile::class, nullable: true)]
    private ?Profile $profile;

    public function __construct(?Profile $profile = null)
    {
        $this->profile = $profile;
    }

    public function profile(): ?Profile
    {
        return $this->profile;
    }

    public function setProfile(?Profile $profile): void
    {
        $this->profile = $profile;
    }
}

```

Inverse side of the relationship can be defined in the `Profile` entity:

```php filename="app/Entities/Profile.php"
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Entities;

use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Entity;
use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Relation\BelongsTo;

#[Entity]
class Profile
{
    // ...

    #[BelongsTo(target: User::class)]
    private User $user;

    public function user(): User
    {
        return $this->user;
    }

    public function changeUser(User $user): void
    {
        $this->user = $user;
    }

    // ...
}
```

It's important to handle cases where the relation is not initialized (`null`).

By default, the ORM generates an outer key in the child object using the parent entity's role and inner key (usually the primary key). As a result, a column and foreign key will be added to the child entity (e.g., `Profile`) on a column like `user_id`.

### Usage

To attach a child object to the parent entity, simply set the value on the designated property. For example:

```php
$user = new User();
$user->setProfile(new Profile());

// or, directly,
// if public properties are used
$user->profile = new Profile();
```

The related object can be immediately saved into the database by persisting the parent entity:

```php
$manager = app(EntityManagerInterface::class);

$manager->persist($user);
$manager->run();
```

To delete a previously associated object simply set the property value to `null`:

```php
$user->setProfile(null);

// or, directly,
// if public properties are used
$user->profile = null;

$manager->persist($user);
$manager->run();
```

The child object will be removed during the persist operation.

    To avoid child object removal (detach) set `nullable` to `true`. In this case, child outer key will be reset to `null`.
