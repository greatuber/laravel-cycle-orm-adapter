# Has Many (One-to-Many)

The `HasMany` relationship links one entity to multiple related entities. For example, if each user can have multiple posts, this relationship can be annotated in the `User` entity.

```php filename="app/Entities/User.php"
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace App\Entities;

use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Column;
use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Entity;
use Cycle\Annotated\Annotation\Relation\HasMany;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

#[Entity]
class User
{
    #[Column(type: 'primary')]
    private string $id;

    #[HasMany(target: App\Entities\Post::class)]
    private Collection $posts;
}
```
